# LandFY

LandFY is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform for real estate projects, built on Solana using Anchor. The platform allows users to invest in fractional property ownership, track their investments, and participate in governance through proposals and voting.

## Features

-   **Fractional Property Ownership**: Tokenized real estate properties, allowing users to invest in fractions of a property.
-   **Property Investment**: Users can invest in properties using USDC and receive tokens representing their ownership.
-   **Dividend Distribution**: Investors can claim dividends based on their property ownership.
-   **Governance**: Investors can create and vote on proposals, such as minting additional tokens or changing the property administrator.
-   **Secure Withdrawals**: Investors can withdraw their investments, returning their tokens and receiving USDC.
-   **Property Closure**: Administrators can close properties after all tokens are burned or withdrawn.

## Technologies Used

-   **Blockchain**: Solana, Anchor
-   **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js
-   **Database**: Supabase
-   **Cache**: Redis
-   **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
-   **Others**: Axios, React Context, Solana Wallet Adapter

## Installation

### **Prerequisites**

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
-   [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
-   [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcelofeitoza/landfy.git
cd landfy
```

### **Configure Environment Variables**

#### **Backend**

Create a `.env` file inside the `app/server/` directory and add the following variables:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
SUPABASE_KEY=<your_supabase_jwt_key>
PORT=5500
ADM=<keypair_bytes>
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
```

**Variable Descriptions:**

-   `SUPABASE_URL`: URL of your Supabase instance.
-   `SUPABASE_KEY`: JWT key for accessing Supabase.
-   `PORT`: Port on which the backend server will run.
-   `ADM`: Array of bytes representing the administrative keypair.
-   `REDIS_URL`: Connection URL for Redis (set to `redis://redis:6379` for Docker, or `localhost:6379` if running Redis locally).

#### **Frontend**

Create a `.env.local` file inside the `app/client/` directory and add the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADM="<keypair_bytes>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:5500"
```

**Variable Descriptions:**

-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADM`: Administrative keypair used in the frontend.
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: URL of the backend API (set to `http://localhost:5500` for local development).

**Note:** Ensure that `.env` and `.env.local` files are listed in `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

### **Install Dependencies**

#### **Backend**

```bash
cd app/server
yarn install
```

#### **Frontend**

```bash
cd app/client
yarn install
```

### **Build the Program**

From the root of the project, execute:

```bash
anchor build
```

### **Test the Program**

From the root of the project, execute:

```bash
anchor test
```

### **Deploy the Program**

To deploy the program to a Solana cluster (e.g., Devnet), execute:

```bash
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet # Ensure you have enough SOL to pay for the deployment
```

### **Start the Backend Server**

```bash
cd app/server
yarn start # Make sure Supabase is set up and Redis is running- with Docker or locally
```

### **Start the Frontend Server**

```bash
cd app/client
yarn start
```

## Running with Docker

To simplify running the application, you can use Docker. Follow the steps below:

### **Build and Run Containers**

From the root of the project, execute:

```bash
cd app/server
docker compose up --build -d
```

### **Verify the Containers**

To check if the services are running correctly, execute:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**

#### **Backend (`app/server/.env`)**

-   **SUPABASE_URL**: URL of your Supabase instance.
-   **SUPABASE_KEY**: JWT key for accessing Supabase.
-   **PORT**: Port on which the backend server will run.
-   **ADM**: Array of bytes representing the administrative keypair.
-   **REDIS_URL**: Connection URL for Redis (`redis://redis:6379` for Docker).

-   **NEXT_PUBLIC_ADM**: Administrative keypair used in the frontend.
-   **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL**: URL of the backend API (`http://localhost:5500` for local development).

**Note:** Do not include `.env` and `.env.local` files in version control. They are already listed in `.gitignore` in each directory.

## Usage
